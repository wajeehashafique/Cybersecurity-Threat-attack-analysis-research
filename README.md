# IoT Cybersecurity Threats

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of various cybersecurity threats and attacks in IoT and critical infrastructure systems. It covers real-world examples, identifies potential vulnerabilities, and proposes security mechanisms to prevent or detect these attacks.

## Key Topics:
- **Cyber-attacks on critical infrastructures**: Analysis of attacks such as dam cyber-attacks and healthcare system breaches.
- **IoT Security**: Investigation into IoT vulnerabilities like Zigbee and Z-Wave protocol attacks.
- **Common Cyber Attacks**:
  - **SQL Injection**
  - **Phishing**
  - **Malware Injection**
  - **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**
- **Attack Categories**:
  - Active and Passive
  - Threat categories such as Disruption, Usurpation, and Unauthorized Disclosure.

## Security Mechanisms:
This analysis suggests key methods to mitigate cyber-attacks, including:
- Access control measures
- Encryption methods for data integrity
- Intrusion detection systems
- Regular security updates and input validation techniques.

## CIA Triad Focus:
The project emphasizes threats to the **Confidentiality, Integrity,** and **Availability** of IoT and critical infrastructure systems.
